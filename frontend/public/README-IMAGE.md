- The device screen showing the SmartBiz ERP dashboard interface
- Modern, clean, business-focused environment
- Natural lighting, professional setting
- Diverse representation (inclusive imagery)
- Positive, confident expression

### Alternative Image Ideas:

1. **Dashboard View**: Screenshot of the actual ERP dashboard with charts and analytics

4. **Modern Office**: Clean, modern office space with technology

### How to Add the Image:

1. Place your image file in the `public` folder

3. The image will automatically load on the login page

### Current Fallback:

If no image is found, the login page will display a beautiful gradient background with the promotional content.
